# feed-list-demo

- I have included AFNetworking and Realm to facilitate retrieving data from the service and persistency.
- The frameworks were compiled locally and I have included them manually -- no dependency on Carthage, yet the Cartfile is included in case necessary.
- Also included a UI category to handle UIRefreshControl programatically.
- Git branches were not deleted on purpose.

Otherwise it should _just work_. ðŸ˜„
